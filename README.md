# AuthN/AuthZ/RoleGuards

This is a repository with a basic user management system using cookies/jwtGuard/localGuard/Public-routers etc.
---

## Structure

- [Auth Module](src/auth/)
  - Contains all endpoints needed to register/login and logout a user.
  - `TODO: Refresh Token`
- [User Module](src/users/)
  - Contains endpoints for CRUD on users.
  - The Role guard allows only the passed Role.`
## Guards

- [JwtAuthGuard](src/auth/strategies/jwt.strategy.js): 
  - Is set globally in [app.module](src/app.module.ts), to overwrite this, use the [@Public()](src/auth/guards/public.guard.ts) Decorator.
  - On login `cookie` with jwt based on `secretKey(.env)` and user data is created.
  - On Guarded requests, checks database if user with id provided by the token exists in database and authorizes request.
  - On logout `cookie` with jwt token is replaced with an empty cookie.
- [OptionalJwtAuthGuard](src/auth/guards/optionalJwtAuth.guard.ts)
  - Gives the possibility to add the user to the request if it exists but also allows non users
- [LocalAuthGuard](src/auth/guards/localAuth.guard.ts)
  - Guard used on login where no jwt is present, can be adjusted but uses email and password 
- [PublicGuard](src/auth/guards/localAuth.guard.ts)
  - If used revokes the global `JwtAuthGuard`, if other Guards are used with `@UseGuards()` unless they also have `canActivate` overriden, will apply
- [RoleGuard](src/auth/guards/role.guard.ts)
  - Can be used to allow endpoints for only certain roles.

## Basic User Schema
[User](./src/users/entities/user.entity.ts):
```js
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  username: string, password: string, email: string,
  firstName: string, lastName: string,
  role: Role,
  lastLogin: Date, createdAt: Date, updatedAt: Date, 
  deletedAt: Date, deleted: boolean
}
```

## Running the app with docker

Note that I use MongoDB Atlas and not an DB Image (might come later)

Also a .env file is needed, here an [example](./.sample.env)

```bash
# development (~600MB)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# production (~300MB)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
```
## Running the app dockerless

```bash
# setup
npm i

# development
npm run start

# watch mode
npm run start:dev

# production mode
npm run start:prod
```

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
npm run test

# e2e tests
npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
npm run test:cov
```
